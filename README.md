# Enhanced-Multi-level-Feeback-Queue
- This project presents an improved version of the Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling algorithm implemented in Java. 
- The aim is to enhance the efficiency of process scheduling in a multiprocessor system.
- The algorithm incorporates two key features: multiple priority queues and dynamic priority adjustment.
- Processes are divided into three priority queues based on their characteristics and resource requirements, and their priorities change dynamically during execution.
- An aging mechanism prevents starvation by promoting processes from lower priority queues to higher ones over time.
- The algorithm utilizes two processors to execute processes concurrently, improving system performance.
- The project demonstrates the benefits of these enhancements through the implementation and evaluation of the algorithm.
- The improved MLFQ algorithm optimizes process allocation, resource utilization, and response times.
- It provides fair scheduling across multiple priority levels and ensures efficient use of system resources.
- The results show improved system throughput, reduced waiting times, and better overall performan
